      [IMPROVEMENTS]
      * Do not modify the args hash, it is a user supplied reference, and removing headers from it is a noop since the headers key is already defined after the args when calling request().
      * No need to double clone the headers hash.
      * Update Carp::Internal so that croak()s actually end up at a useful place.
      * All done by @bluefeet, thanks!
